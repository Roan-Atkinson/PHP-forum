PHP-forum is a simple, lighweight forum system written in PHP. This was made as part of a 48 hour competition, so it is not particularily secure, nor verbose.

Features include:
- login system
- register system
- make new posts
- delete posts
- comments on posts
- anoonymous comments and posts

known security issues include:
- **severe** XSS vulnerability
- **very** weak session id generation

I feel it worth pointing out that due to the context of which this project was created, I will not be performing any major updates or fixing any of these security issues.
